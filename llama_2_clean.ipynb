From the moment I turned it on after setting it up, I encountered a black screen twice. I had to continuously reboot the laptop. Additionally, the computer's performance was much slower than my expectations, with noticeable lags. Today was my first day using it, and despite needing a new laptop urgently, I do not wish to keep this one. I was specifically looking for a laptop with built-in document reader, scanner, and photo editor capabilities.\n",

I have decided to just build a pc since it is cheaper and have a better performance anyway. I am leaving a comment to remind the buyers to see if the price keep on increasing then just buy the i7 one instead. The i7-9750h (way faster cpu) come with gpu rxt 2060 (bang on the money) and 16 go of ddr4 ram (no upgrade needed.) Only thing is to add another ssd or hhd (2tb recommended.) Hope if this help! \n",

With that, not to mention bending, even going into water wouldn't be a problem. I applied for a replacement after it was bent, but the after-sales staff bent it back by hand and sent it back to me. Even if it's bent back, they should get my agreement, right? Is it unreasonable to deal with it without my agreement? This is how it was when I received it, why should consumers pay for it? After-sales service is just kicking the ball around. They told me to find them, then they told me to find others, what the hell? Why do such good advertising? Also, \"180 days replacement without repair\", if you can't do it, don't brag. Just bought it and they won't give me a new one. Also claimed 180 days replacement without repair, are they deceiving your grandpa? Playing word games is interesting? Only system problems will be replaced, the shell won't be replaced. If you can't do it, don't brag. What the hell... My motherboard was broken by their after-sales service, and they won't replace it. It must be a system problem to work. .....**...... \n",
