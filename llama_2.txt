df = pd.read_excel('novel_generate_v3.xlsx')
df = df[:1000].random
columns = [label, novel_reason, review], only novel reviews have novel_reason, empty otherwise
train : val : test = 400:200:400

1. Randomly select 5/10/20/38 training data (random_seed=11/22/44) (76 data resulted in model server overload)
2. Generate reasons for each train data, temperature=0/.25/.5/.75/1
  system = 'You are a helpful customer review expert'
  prompt = 
    "Given customer review: {review} And its expected output, 0 for review with common needs and 1 for review with novel needs: {label}, because the laptop has {novel_reason} Explain the reasons why the input corresponds to the given expected output one by one. The reasons should be placed within tags <reason> and </reason>."
3. Summarize the reasons above, temperature=0/.25/.5/.75/1
  system = 'You are a helpful customer review expert'
  prompt = 
    "{reasons} Given input and expected output pairs, along with the reason for generated outputs, provide a summarized common reason applicable to all cases within tags <summary> and </summary>. The summary should explain the underlying principles, logic or methodology governing the relationship between the inputs and corresponding outputs. Avoid mentioning any specific details, numbers, or entities from the individual examples, and aim for a generalized explanation."
4. Generate prediction labels for each test data, model temperature same as step 3
  system = 
    "You are a highly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) model, specifically designed to analyze and classify customer reviews based on their needs. Your primary function is to determine whether a review expresses common or novel needs, and return a corresponding output of 0 or 1. With your sophisticated language understanding capabilities, you can accurately identify the nuances of customer feedback, recognizing patterns and sentiment that may not be immediately apparent. Your training data consists of a vast array of customer reviews, allowing you to develop a deep understanding of the language and terminology used to express various needs. When a customer review is inputted, you quickly process the text, analyzing the language, tone, and context to determine the type of need being expressed. 
    Your advanced algorithms and machine learning models enable you to distinguish between common needs and novel needs. 
    {reasons_summary}
    With your high degree of accuracy, you can confidently return an output of 0 for reviews with common needs or an output of 1 for reviews with novel needs, nothing else. Your capabilities make you an invaluable asset in understanding customer needs, enabling businesses to tailor their products and services to meet the evolving demands of their customers."
  prompt = test data one by one
5. Store the prediction labels and generate confusion matrix. Best hyperparameters is temperature=0.75/0.75

For 0/5/10-shot baselines, direct to step 4, temperature=0.75
  system = 
    "{training customer reviews & corresponding labels} Return an output of 0 for reviews with common needs or an output of 1 for reviews with novel needs, nothing else"
  prompt = test data one by one
